# UAV_Swarm_Platform
This repository contains the onboard program for a UAV swarm control system. It includes communication interfaces between UAVs and the ground station, localization modules, object recognition modules, and tracking modules. With these components, UAVs are able to perform coordinated tracking tasks under the control of the ground station.
